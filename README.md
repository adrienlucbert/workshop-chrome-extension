# workshop-chrome-extension

> This repository is used as a support for a workshop given at Epitech Bordeaux (IT School).

Creating a web browser extension is not as challenging as it seems, and is sometimes more relevant than creating a whole website. Learn how to create an extension on Google Chrome browser (which is quite similar to developing an extension for Mozilla Firefox), which goal is to retrieve your upcoming events from Epitech's intranet.

TODOs:
- [x] Epitech's Intranet API requester
- [ ] Store API token
- [ ] Retrieve upcoming events with a backgroup script
- [ ] Show badges when new events have been retrieved
- [ ] Basic UI
